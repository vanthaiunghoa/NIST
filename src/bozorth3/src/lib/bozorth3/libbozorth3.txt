 bz_comp -  takes a set of minutiae (probe or gallery) and
            compares/measures  each minutia's {x,y,t} with every
            other minutia's {x,y,t} in the set creating a table
            of pairwise comparison entries
 bz_find -  trims sorted table of pairwise minutia comparisons to
            a max distance of 75^2
 bz_match - takes the two pairwise minutia comparison tables (a probe
            table and a gallery table) and compiles a list of
            all relatively "compatible" entries between the two
            tables generating a match table
 bz_match_score - takes a match table and traverses it looking for
            a sufficiently long path (or a cluster of compatible paths)
            of "linked" match table entries
            the accumulation of which results in a match "score"
 bz_sift -  main routine handling the path linking and match table
            traversal
 bz_final_loop - (declared static) a final postprocess after
            the main match table traversal which looks to combine
            clusters of compatible paths
 malloc_or_exit - allocates a buffer of bytes from the heap of
        specified length exiting directly upon system error
 malloc_or_return_error - allocates a buffer of bytes from the heap
        of specified length returning an error code upon system error
 bozorth_probe_init -   creates the pairwise minutia comparison
                        table for the probe fingerprint
 bozorth_gallery_init - creates the pairwise minutia comparison
                        table for the gallery fingerprint
 bozorth_to_gallery -   supports the matching scenario where the
                        same probe fingerprint is matches repeatedly
                        to multiple gallery fingerprints as in
                        identification mode
 bozorth_main -         supports the matching scenario where a
                        single probe fingerprint is to be matched
                        to a single gallery fingerprint as in
                        verificaiton mode
 parse_line_range - parses strings of the form #-# into the upper
            and lower bounds of a range corresponding to lines in
            an input file list
 set_progname - stores the program name for the current invocation
 set_probe_filename - stores the name of the current probe file
            being processed
 set_gallery_filename - stores the name of the current gallery file
            being processed
 get_progname - retrieves the program name for the current invocation
 get_probe_filename - retrieves the name of the current probe file
            being processed
 get_gallery_filename - retrieves the name of the current gallery
            file being processed
 get_next_file - gets the next probe (or gallery) filename to be
            processed, either from the command line or from a
            file list
 get_score_filename - returns the filename to which the output line
            should be written
 get_score_line - formats output lines based on command line options
            specified
 bz_load -  loads the contents of the specified XYT file into
            structured memory
 fd_readable - when multiple bozorth processes are being run
            concurrently and one of the processes determines a
            has been found, the other processes poll a file
            descriptor using this function to see if they
            should exit as well
 sort_quality_decreasing - comparison function passed to stdlib
            qsort() used to sort minutia qualities
 sort_x_y - comparison function passed to stdlib qsort() used
            to sort minutia coordinates increasing first on x
            then on y
 sort_order_decreasing - calls a custom quicksort that sorts
            a list of integers in decreasing order
