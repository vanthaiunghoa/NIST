 jpegb_decode_mem - Decodes a datastream of JPEGB compressed bytes
                    from a memory buffer, returning a lossy
                    reconstructed pixmap.
 jpegb_decode_file - Decodes a datastream of JPEGB compressed bytes
                    from an open file, returning a lossy
                    reconstructed pixmap.
 jpegb_encode_mem - JPEGB encodes image data storing the compressed
                    bytes to a memory buffer.
 jpegb_encode_file - JPEGB encodes image data storing the compressed
                    bytes to an open file.
 read_marker_jpegb - Reads a specified JPEG marker from
                     an open file.
 getc_marker_jpegb - Reads a specified JPEG marker from a
                     memory buffer.
 put_nistcom_jpegb - Inserts a NISTCOM comment into a JPEGB datastream.
 read_nistcom_jpegb - Reads the first NISTCOM comment from an
                     open JPEGB file.
 getc_nistcom_jpegb - Reads the first NISTCOM comment from a
                     memory buffer containing a JPEGB datastream.
 jpeg_membuf_dest - JPEGB destination manager designed to write
                    compression results to a memory buffer.
 jpeg_membuf_src - JPEGB source manager designed to read compressed
                    data from a memory buffer.
 get_ppi_jpegb - If possible, computes and returns the scan resolution
                 in pixels per inch of a JPEGB datastream given a
                 JPEGB decompess structure.
