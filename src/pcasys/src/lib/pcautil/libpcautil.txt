 classes_read_ncls - Finds number of classes in class file.
 classes_read_pindex - Determines if class file contains indices
                       or vectors (floats) to define class of
                       each print.
 classes_read_subvector_ind - Reads a subset of a class file
                              containing class indices.
 number_classes - Determines the number of unique classes in
                  set of class indices.
 matrix_writerow_init - An initialization routine, called once
                        before multiple calls of matrix_writerow.
 matrix_writerow - Writes one row to a matrix file.
 matrix_write -  Writes a matrix of floats as a file.
 matrix_readrow_init - An initialization routine, called once
                       before multiple calls of matrix_readrow.
 matrix_readrow - Reads one row of a matrix file.
 matrix_read_dims - Returns the dimensions of the matrix.
 matrix_read - Reads a matrix file of floats.
 matrix_read_submatrix - Reads a submatrix of the matrix file.
 covariance_write - Writes a covariance buffer to a file.
 covariance_read_order_nvecs - Reads the order, and no. of vectors
                               used, of a covariance file.
 covariance_read - Reads a covariance file into a buffer.  The buffer
                   contains the nonstrict lower triangle of the
                   covariance matrix only, in row-major order.
 covariance_read_old - Reads a covariance file into a buffer.
                       Allocates the buffer to the size needed to
                       contain the full matrix, then loads the data
                       into the nonstrict upper triangle.
 creat_ch - tries to creat a file
 dptr2ptr_uchar - converts [][] into *
 erode - erodes a raster
 exists - finds out whether a file exists
 fopen_ch - tries to fopen a file
 fopen_noclobber - tries to fopen a file for writing, unless it exists
 get_datadir - tries to find the pcasys data directory
 isverbose - finds out whether the verbosity is on
 lastcomp - finds last component of a pathname
 linecount - counts the lines in a file
 linreg - linear regression
 malloc_ch - tries to malloc a buffer
 open_read_ch - tries to open a file for reading
 rcfill - fills holes in the rows and cols of a raster
 rsblobs - removes small blobs from a raster
 setverbose - sets the verbosity
 sleepity - sleep, or wait for user to hit return key
 summary - computes and writes summary info for a test run
 tilde_filename - changes ~/string to home-dir/string
 usage_func - for use by the "usage" macro
 Usage_func - for use by the "Usage" macro
 write_ihdr_std - writes ihdr file with many "standard" fields

 transform_featvecs - (called by rws_to_acerror.)
 optrws_pnn_acerror - runs PNN on feature vectors, computing
                      error rate.
 swap_float_bytes_vec_cpy - Allocates a new float vector and copies
            the data into it with the byte order swapped.
 swap_float_bytes_vec - Swaps the byte order for a vector of floats.
 table_init - allocates a TABLE that can hold a specified no. of pairs.
 table_store - stores a pair in the table.
 table_lookup - looks up a float against the first elts of the pairs.
 table_clear - sets the number stored back to zero, in effect clearing
               the table.
