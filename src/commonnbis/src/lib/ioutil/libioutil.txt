 read_byte - Reads a byte of data from an open file.

 getc_byte - Reads a byte of data from a memory buffer.

 getc_bytes - Reads a sequence of data bytes from a memory buffer.

 write_byte - Writes a byte of data to an open file.

 putc_byte - Writes a byte of data to a memory buffer.

 putc_byte - Writes a sequence of data bytes to a memory buffer.

 read_ushort - Reads an unsigned short from an open file.

 getc_ushort - Reads an unsigned short from a memory buffer.

 write_ushort - Writes an unsigned short to an open file.

 putc_ushort - Writes an unsigned short to a memory buffer.

 read_uint - Reads an unsigned integer from an open file.

 getc_uint - Reads an unsigned integer from a memory buffer.

 write_uint - Writes an unsigned integer to an open file.

 putc_uint - Writes an unsigned integer to a memory buffer.

 write_bits - Writes a sequence of bits to a memory buffer.

 flush_bits - Writes remaining bits to a memory buffer.

 read_ascii_file - Reads the contents of an ASCII text file
              into a single null-terminated string.
 file_exists - tests to see if the given pathname is an existing file.

 filehead - takes a full pathname and returns the information to the
            left of the rightmost directory level.
 fileroot - takes a file name and strips off the rightmost extension,
            if one is present.
 filesize - opens the specified pathname and determines the size of
            of the file in bytes.
 filetail - takes a full pathname and returns the information to the
            right of the rightmost directory level.
 find_file - takes a directory path and a filename and determines if
             the file exists.
 newext - takes a filename, strips off the rightmost extenstion, and
          appends a new extension.  This routine exits upon error.
 newext_ret - takes a filename, strips off the rightmost extenstion, and
          appends a new extension.  This routine returns an error code.
 newextlong - takes a pointer to a filename, strips the rightmost
		 extenstion, and appends an arbitrary new extension.
 read_strstr_file - Routine opens a column-formatted text file
                    parsing in the first column as a list of strings
                    and the second column as a list of strings.
 read_fltflt_file - Routine opens a column-formatted text file
                    parsing in the first column as a list of floats
                    and the second column as a list of floats.
