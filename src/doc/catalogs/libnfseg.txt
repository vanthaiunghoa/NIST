 segment_fingers - Segments a single finger (removes white space) or
                   four-finger plain impression fingerprint image into
                   single finger images.
 dynamic_threshold - Thresholds image, adjusting threshold based on
                     # of pixels below mean pixel value
 remove_lines - Removes black lines from edge of image caused by 
                a fingerprint card.
 accum_blk_wht - Counts number of black or white pixels along a line
                 of a given width, defined by BLK_DW and WHT_DW in nfseg.h
 find_digits - Finds four "best" (based on a normalized score) fingers
               in the four-finger plain impression by searching over a
               range of angles.
 find_digit_edges - Refine the edge locations between the fingers.
 get_edge_coords - Convert edge locations to coordinates in the image.
 get_fing_boxes - Compute the box coordinates of all four fingers.
 get_fing_seg_pars - Compute the center (sx,sy) and dimensions (sw,sh)
                     of the four segmented fingers.
 get_segfing_bounds - Fine tune image to minimize size and only include
                      fingerprint in the image.
 accum_top_row - Counts white along rows. Used to detect top of
                 fingerprint.
 accum_top_col_blk - Counts black pixels along columns. Used to
                     detect top of fingerprint.
 accum_top_col_wht - Counts white pixels along columns. Used to
                     detect top of fingerprint.
 get_top_score - Detects top of fingerprint from a normalized score.
 adjust_top_up - Adjust location of top (especially if the print goes off
                 the top of the image.
 find_segfing_bottom - Detects bottom of fingerprint.
 find_segfing_sides - Detects sides of the fingerprint.
 adjust_fing_seg_pars - Adjust parameters based on image rotation.
 err_check_finger - Make checks of segmented width, height and spacing.
 scale_seg_fingers - Scale parameters back to original image size.
 parse_segfing - Parse fingers from original image data.
 new_fgp - Calculate the new fgp for part of a segmented fingerprint 
           image.
 write_parsefing - Write segmented/parsed fingers to files.
 insert_int_item - Insert an integer item into an ANSI NIST file.
 insert_parsefing - Add segmented/parsed fingers to a SEG or ASEG
                    field in a Type-14 record, with a comment
                    indicating the source.
 segment_fingers - Segments a single finger (removes white space)
              or four-finger plain impression fingerprint image
              into single finger images.
 new_fgp - Calculate the new fgp for part of a segmented fingerprint 
              image.
 write_parsefing - Write out parsed finger records to files, with
            filenames based on the input filename.  For ANSI/NIST
            files, the record number is also appended to make
            sure each filename is unique.  For single-image
            files, use a negative record number and it will be
            ignored.
 insert_int_item - Insert an integer item into an ANSI NIST file
              structure at the specified location.
 insert_parsefing - Add segmented/parsed fingers to a SEG or ASEG
                    field in a Type-14 record, with a comment
                    indicating the source.  One subfield is used
                    for each finger found, and a comment
                    indicates that the corresponding subfields
                    were generated by nfseg.
