 rdimgwh - Reads an image or images from an old style image file
              or an ANSI/NIST file, and prints the width and
              height from the information embedded in the image
              data.  This should be the same as the width and
              height specified in any metadata associated with
              the image; there is an option to check this in AN2K
              files.  For non ANSI/NIST files, only the beginning
              of the file is read, and in either case only about
              enough is parsed to find the required width and
              height data.
 get_wsq_wh - This routine does some of what wsq_decode_mem() in
              imgtools/src/lib/wsq/decoder.c does, but only about
              as much as necessary to get the image width and
              height.
 get_jpegl_wh - This routine does some of what jpegl_decode_mem()
              in imgtools/src/lib/jpegl/decoder.c does, but only
              about as much as necessary to get the image width
              and height. (Neither this function, nor
              jpegl_decode_mem() appear to be able to handle all
              possible jpegl files, but they do handle all the
              jpegl files that the NBIS code creates.)
 get_jpegb_wh - This routine does some of what jpegb_decode_mem()
              in imgtools/src/lib/ijg/src/lib/jpegb/decoder.c
              does, but only about as much as necessary to get
              the image width and height.
 get_ihead_wh_file - Gets the width and height of an IHEAD by reading 
              the values out of an IHEAD struct.
 get_jp2_wh_stream - Return the size of a jp2 format image
              accessed through a JasPer stream.  This function
              provides the core functionality for the other two
              "get_jp2_wh" functions, which each create the
              required kind of JasPer stream before calling it.
 get_jp2_wh - Return the size of a jp2 format image in a buffer.
 get_jp2_wh_file - Return the size of a jp2 image in a file.
              
 get_png_wh_file - Open a PNG file and read enough to find the
              image width and height.
 get_png_wh - Parse a PNG file in memory and find the image width
              and height.
 get_wh - It would be easy get the width and height by calling
              read_and_decode_image() instead of using all the
              code below, but it would read and decode the entire
              image, which is way more I/O and computing than
              necessary, since the width and height are typically
              found in the image header.
 get_wh_from_file - Opens and reads in the beginning of an image
              file, so that the file data in memory can be passed
              to get_wh().  This approach works for the old-style
              single-image files but not for AN2K files, which
              may contain multiple images.
