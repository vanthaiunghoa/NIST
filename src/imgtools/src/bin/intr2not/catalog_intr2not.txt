 intr2not - Takes an IHead or raw pixmap with interleaved color
            components.  It de-interleaves the pixmap creating
            one 8-bit image plane for each color component.  This
            can handle specific downsamplings of component planes
            that are commonly used with YCbCr colorspace images.
