 dwsq14 - Takes an IHead formatted, WSQ compressed, image file,
        such as those used in the distribution of legacy data on
        NIST Special Database 14 and decodes it, reconstructing a
        "lossy" pixmap and saving it to an IHead or raw image file.
        This program should be used to convert legacy data only.
        The format of the files processed by this program should
        be considered obsolete.
