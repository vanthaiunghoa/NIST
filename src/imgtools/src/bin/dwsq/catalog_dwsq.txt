 dwsq - Takes a WSQ compressed image file and decodes it,
        reconstructing a "lossy" pixmap and saving it to
        an IHead or raw image file.
        This is an implementation based on the Crinimal Justice
        Information Services (CJIS) document "WSQ Gray-scale
        Fingerprint Compression Specification", Dec. 1997.
