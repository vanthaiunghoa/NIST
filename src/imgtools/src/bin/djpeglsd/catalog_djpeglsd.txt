 djpeglsd - Takes an IHead formatted, JPEGL compressed, image file,
            such as those distributed with NIST Special Databases
            {4,9,10,18} and decodes it, reconstructing a "lossless"
            pixmap and saving it to an IHead or raw image file.
            If the input file is from a NIST Special Database, then
            image attributes are stored as a separate NISTCOM text file.
            This program should be used to convert legacy data only.
            The format of the files processed by this program should
            be considered obsolete.
