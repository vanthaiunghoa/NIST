 sd_rfmt - Takes an IHead encapsulated image file from the NIST
           archive of fingerprint and mugshot NIST Special Databases
           {4,9,10,14,&18}.  The file is converted into a
           "standardized" JPEGL or WSQ format.  Attribute data
           stored in the input IHead header is reformatted and
           stored in a comment block in the output file.
           This program should be used to convert legacy data only.
           The format of the files processed by this program should
           be considered obsolete.
