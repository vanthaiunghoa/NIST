NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARD AND TECHNOLOGY
------------------------------------------------
This is a NIST program
Having 2 algo MINDTCT and BOZORTH3

Terminal.java is a code which runs all the command in terminal using java code

MindTCT detects all the minutea and generate file with .xyt extension
Bozorth3 comapre both the minutea file and genretate the result
In my case full match image is getting a minutea rate of 494.

Image Group of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
NIST Fingerprint Image Software Version 2 (NFIS2)
Developed for Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Aims to facilitate and support the automated manipulation and processing of fingerprint images.

NFIS2 contains 7 general categories. 
We investigate 4 out of 7: PCASYS, MINDTCT, NFIQ and BOZORTH3. 
PCASYS is a neural-network based fingerprint classification system, which categorized a fingerprint image into the class of arch, left or right loop, scar, tented arch, or whorl. 
PCASYS is the only known no cost system of its kind. 

MINDTCT is a minutiae detector that automatically locates and records ridge ending and bifurcations in a fingerprint image. 
MINDTCT includes minutiae quality assessment based on local image conditions. 
The FBI’s Universal Latent Workstation uses MINDTCT, and it too is the only known no cost system of its kind

BOZORTH3 is a minutiae based fingerprint matching algorithm that will do both one-to-one and one-to-many matching operations.  
BOZORTH3 matching algorithm computes a match score between the minutiae from any two fingerprints to help determine if they are from the same finger.
BOZORTH3 accepts minutiae generated by the MINDTCT algorithm. 
Written by Allan S. Bozorth while at the FBI.

PCASYS is a prototype/demonstration pattern-level fingerprint classification program. 
It is provided in the form of a source code distribution and is intended to run on a desktop workstation. 
The program reads and classifies each of a set of fingerprint image files, optionally displaying the results of several processing stages in graphical form. 
This distribution contains 2700 fingerprint images that may be used to demonstrate the classifier; it can also be run on user-provided images.

Minutiae Detection (MINDTCT)
--------------------------------
MINDTCT takes a fingerprint image and locates all minutiae in the image, assigning to each minutia point its location, orientation, type, and quality.
The command, mindtct, reads a fingerprint image from an ANSI/NIST, WSQ, baseline JPEG, lossless JPEG file, or IHead formatted file.
Mindtct outputs the minutiae identification based on the ANSI/NIST standard or the M1 (ANSI INCITS 378-2004) representation.

Minutiae Matching (BOZORTH3)
-------------------------------
The BOZORTH3 matcher uses only the location (x,y) and orientation (theta) of the minutia points to match the fingerprints. 
The matcher builds separate tables for the fingerprints being matched that define distance and orientation between minutia in each fingerprint. 
These two tables are then compared for compatibility and a new table is constructed that stores information showing the inter-fingerprint compatibility. 
The inter-finger compatibility table is used to create a match score by looking at the size and number of compatible minutia clusters.

Two key things are important to note regarding this fingerprint matcher:
1. Minutia features are exclusively used and limited to location (x,y) and orientation ‘t’, represented as {x,y,t}.
2. The algorithm is designed to be rotation and translation invariant.
